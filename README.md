# Data-Analytics---Retail-Store-Daily-Sales-Revenue-Prediction-and-Forecasting
This project uses R-Programming and analyzes three months of daily sales data (June-August 2025) from a local retail store to predict high-revenue days and forecast future sales. We used classification and time series forecasting techniques to develop models that support strategic business decisions.

** Key Findings: Weekend revenue averages $5,069, compared to $3,498 on weekdays—a 45%
increase. Customer traffic is the strongest revenue driver (r = 0.86). Promotions generate a 9.7%
revenue lift, though not statistically significant due to limited sample size (only 13 promotion
days). Classification models achieved 82.6% accuracy in predicting high vs. low revenue days.
Time series forecasting using SARIMA achieved an RMSE of $900 for 7-day predictions.

** Recommendations: Increase weekend staffing by 30–40% and reduce staffing on low-traffic days
(especially Monday and Friday).Focus promotions on underperforming weekdays to balance weekly
revenue.Use SARIMA forecasts to plan weekly inventory and adjust stock levels before weekends.

** Business Impact: These models enable proactive decision-making for staffing optimization, targeted promotions, and inventory management, with potential annual cost savings of 10-15% through
improved operational efficiency.
